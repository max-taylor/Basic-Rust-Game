# Basic Game

Basic rust game to understand the concepts better.

Using [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm) to handling writing to the output.

This game functions much better if the terminal its running in has an aspect ratio of 1, otherwise its distorted, the logic assumes pixels are even height/width for simplicity.
